# QuackScript
QuackScript is a delightfully unhinged programming language that thrives on chaos and caffeine. Packed with quirky built-ins like coffee() to turbocharge execution, yell() to shout every output in ALL CAPS at triple speed, and blameSomeone() to throw random exceptions at imaginary culprits — it’s the perfect tool when you want your code to be as unpredictable as your creative process.
